QUESTION 1
Execution time for IS-b: 49.399 ms 
Execution time for BIS-b: 62.144 ms
Explanation for performance difference: Usually BIS can be more benefitial if
a sufficiently hige proportion of the table is selected, resulting a more
sequential scan than just index scan. However, if BIS does not result in a
more sequencial scan of disk pages, the extra overhead involved in the process
of sorting first will actually slow down the performance. So we see that in
this case IS is faster without the overhead.


QUESTION 2
Execution time for IS-cb: 154.001 ms
Execution time for BIS-cb: 141.214 ms
Explanation for performance difference: For cb_idx, 'c = 10' is a matching
predicate therefore the scanning can be faster by making use of cb_idx. BIS is
faster than IS because when comparing to IS, BIS' sorting in memory ensures
that the disk IO access is less random, which reduce number of IO operations
required, resulting a faster execution. And in this case, the overhead
involved in sorting index first is smaller than the benefit of BIS.


QUESTION 3
Execution time for BIS-b: 711.143 ms
Execution time for IOS-b: 446.758 ms
Execution time for IOS-cb: 581.016 ms
Explanation for performance difference: The reason that BIS is significantly
slower than the other 2 methods is that it requires RID lookup but in fact int
this case, projection on attribute b can be done during selection. The disk IO
incurred during RID lookup causes it to be much slower. As for IOS-cb, the
database has to scan more pages when compared to IOS-b because cb_idx is
larger than b_idx, resulting in more pages required for storage when number of
records is fixed.


QUESTION 4
Execution time for BIS-cb: 7.088 ms
Execution time for ABIS-b-c: 36.834 ms
Explanation for performance difference: For query D, 'b = 9 AND c = 10' is the
matching predicate for cb_idx and therefore, BIS-cb is faster than the two
terms being filtered via BIS and then AND two results together which requires
two RID lookups for each term.


QUESTION 5
Query: select * from r where (b = 0) and (c > 0)
Execution time for IS-b: 57.025 ms
Execution time for BIS-cb: 195.378 ms


QUESTION 6
Best query plan: BIS-cb
Execution time for best plan: 103.752 ms
Worst query plan: SS
Execution time for worst plan: 532.703 ms
